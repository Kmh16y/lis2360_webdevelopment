<table border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0">
	<tr>
		<td>Pro:
		 Inventory Control</td>
		<td>Better inventory control leads to better customer experience, especially critical in chains with multiple store locations and hitting the expectations of omnichannel fulfillment. </td>
		</tr>
		
		<tr>
			<td>Con:Privacy</td>
			<td> Tracking doens't just stop when someone leaves a store, but will actually continue with the shopper as they go about the rest of their day.  </td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td> Pro: Reduce checkout wait times</td>
			<td> RFIS will eliminate the need to stand and have each item individually scanned, which will allow for a pretty simple checkout process. </td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Con: Security</td>
			<td> RFID tags can be easily cloned if not equipped with a proper authentication mechanism. It can be pretty simple to switch the prices on items in the store. </td>
